# Basic-XCOM-Simulator
A basic XCOM gunfight simulator to teach myself programming.

The game will most likely be updated daily as I keep applying new knowledge.

Features present in the current build (v0.6):
- Distance influencing Hit Chance
- Overwatch
- Half Cover & High Cover Bonus
- Taking Shot
- Hunkering Down
- Moving Up (thus decreasing Distance by 1)
- Very basic "AI" (which is completely RNG-based)

Changelog (v.06):
- Added Overwatch ingame function
- Added new AI behaviors with regards to the new Overwatch function
- Fixed a critical (read: stupid) AI modifier error
