# Basic-XCOM-Simulator
A basic XCOM gunfight simulator to teach myself programming.

The game will most likely be updated daily as I keep applying new knowledge.

Features present in the current build (v0.3):
- Distance influencing Hit Chance
- Half Cover & High Cover Bonus
- Taking Shot
- Hunkering Down
- Moving Up (thus decreasing Distance by 1)
- Very basic "AI" (which is completely RNG-based)
